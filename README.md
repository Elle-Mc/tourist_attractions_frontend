- <b>Planned future enhancements</b>: 
    - I'd really like to update the look and feel and add images. 
    - Would like to have the ability to create and have two separate lists, one for "have been to xyz tourist attraction" and another that's "have not been to xyz tourist attraction" - just so people can more efficiently track.
